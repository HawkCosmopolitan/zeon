# zeon
the project is under active development.
welcome to zeon, a decentralized federated network for all kinds of communities, teams and organizations to collaborate with each other, connect to their clients and manage their resources and even communitcate with other servers and organizations and other federations on this network.
our goal is similiar to matrix network but with more flexibility and ability to be expanded with third party modules being developed by the people and communities to serve services to their own community and clients or even other federations in a secure context and decentralized universe.
there would even much more ideas around purpose of this light weight and fast network and different modules stacks will be changed in future as the project is under development.
this project will be depended on some protocols, softwares and engines such as : RabbitMQ, grpc and etc.
